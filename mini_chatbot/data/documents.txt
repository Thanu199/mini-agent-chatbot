Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI systems can perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.


Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance automatically without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on identifying patterns in data.


Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns. It is commonly used in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.


Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It is used in chatbots, translation systems, and text analysis.


FastAPI is a modern Python web framework used to build fast and efficient APIs. It is widely used in machine learning and AI applications due to its high performance and simplicity.
